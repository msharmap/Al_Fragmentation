# Linking Performance in Dynamic Experiments with Machine Learning. 

Welcome!


This study investigates the optimization of mechanical properties and fragmentation behavior of aluminum powder compacts formed via swaging-assisted powder consolidation (SAPC). SAPC, a metalworking process involving plastic deformation by rotating dies, is utilized to consolidate, enhance density, uniformity, and particle-particle bonding of aluminum powders, thereby improving mechanical properties. We examine three different particle size distributions and degrees of swaging to produce aluminum structural reactive materials (SRMs) and evaluate their quasi-static tensile properties, microstructures, and fragmentation behavior under high-velocity impacts.

The study applied the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) machine learning method to correlate input variables (particle size distribution, degree of swaging) with mechanical properties and fragment size distributions. The results underscored the predominant influence of the degree of swaging over particle size distribution in determining the compacts' mechanical properties – and the importance of mechanical properties on fragment size following impact.
